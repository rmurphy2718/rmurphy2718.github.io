I received my Ph.D. from Purdue University, where I worked with Professors Bruno Ribeiro and Vinayak Rao on machine learning methods for graphs (networks) and sets. Applications for this work include predicting molecular properties, diagnosing neurodegenerative disease, and anomaly detection. I was the GSO Student Seminar Coordinator for Spring 2019/2020: [here is the 2020 seminar schedule ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17mbN4Dv8NEndVxi0ZjFgMSNPRD5PeDuLPtX8rAnh5NQ/edit?usp=sharing).
