I am a Ph.D. candidate at Purdue University working with Professors Bruno Ribeiro (Computer Science) and Vinayak Rao (Statistics and Computer Science) on machine learning methods for graphs (networks) and sets. Applications for this work include predicting molecular properties, diagnosing neurodegenerative disease, and anomaly detection. I was the GSO Student Seminar Coordinator for Spring 2019/2020: [here is the 2020 seminar schedule ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17mbN4Dv8NEndVxi0ZjFgMSNPRD5PeDuLPtX8rAnh5NQ/edit?usp=sharing).
